# leaflet-challenge
In this challenge, leaflet is used to visualize earthquake activity in the US. Each earthquake marker reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. All data was gathered from the following website: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
